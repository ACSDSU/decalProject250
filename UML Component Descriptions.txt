Search Bar

The search bar is available on the landing page. When clicked on it will allow the user to type the product or device that they want to search for. The search bar will then send the user to a results page that will contain all of the products that contain the user’s inputs. If the user types in a device, all of the products that are available for the device will be linked to on the result page. 

Choose Device Page

The Choose Device Page link is available on the landing page. It is a page that has all of the devices that we provide cases for. When you click on a device on the page, it will link to a results page that contains links for all of the products available for said device. 

Result Page

The result page is the page that the user will be linked to after they use the search bar or the Choose Device Page. The page will contain all of the products that are available that fit the search criteria of the users search input. If no product can be found that matches the search, “No result” will be displayed on the page.
