The cart class will be the primary class used to store the items a user has inside their cart. It can be used as a way to organize all their potential purchases prior to checkout. The only data contained in this class is a list of items a user has selected. Amongst that, there are functions of adding and removing items from this block of data as well a function to finally checkout. As every user is equipped with the potential to purchase, this class will be a member of every user.

Payment

This class, or moreso struct, is a collection of data required to make a purchase. Our service only allows payments through direct credit card information.
