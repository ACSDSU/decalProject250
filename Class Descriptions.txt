Cart

The cart class will be the primary class used to store the items a user has inside their cart. It can be used as a way to organize all their potential purchases prior to checkout. The only data contained in this class is a list of items a user has selected. Amongst that, there are functions of adding and removing items from this block of data as well a function to finally checkout. As every user is equipped with the potential to purchase, this class will be a member of every user.

Payment

This class, or moreso struct, is a collection of data required to make a purchase. Our service only allows payments through direct credit card information. Therefore, this class contains the data required for such a purchase to be made. This is made into a class to allow the possibiltiy to expand payment options in the future. The user class will also store a list of payments, allowing the user to choose a prefered payment at checkout.


Shipping

Just like the payment class/struct, this collection of data will be the necessary information to ship products to users after a purchase has been made. The user class stores a list of this class to allow for multiple shipping addresses to be stored and chosen at checkout.

User

Purpose of the user class is to initialize new users, allow them to login to, logout of, and register accounts for our  case making website. It also stores the user's email, username, and passwords. There are 3 methods in this class which are Login(), Logout(), and register(). 
-Register() asks the users for an email, username, and password. If all 3 are valid, then 	an email is sent to the userâ€™s chosen email address, which they most verify. After that all the users information is stored in the user database. If any of the 3 are invalid then a prompt will show up stating the invalid input. 
-Login() takes the username and password of the user and verifies whether they are both correct and in the user database. If both are, then Login()  logs the user into the website. If either is wrong a prompt appears that tells the user that either the username or password is invalid. 
-Logout()  logs the user out of the website.  

Item

Purpose of the item class is to store all the information of each case into the product database. The information stored is the name of the case, a picture of the case, description of the case, the price, and which items the case is compatible with. This information is stored under 5 variables, name, picture, description, price, and compatibility.
